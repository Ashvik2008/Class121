Invisible cloak

To create invisible cloak we will be using image processing techique called color detection and segmentaiton

Color detection

It is a technique where we can detect any color in a given range of HSV color space
HSV is a cylindrical color space (H - Angle V - Height S - Radius)

H = HUE. dominant color as percieved by an observer (0 - red, 120 - green, 240 - blue)
S = Saturation. amount of white light mixed with HUE
V = Value (Brightness). Lower the value, more similar to black, Higher the value more similar to the color itself

Segmentaiton

It is the process of labeling every pixel in an image where each pixel having the same label shares certain characterestics.
